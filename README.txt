Play History

***This is a work in progress***

The idea behind this addon is simply to catalog XBMC play history so that it can be reviewed later. Sure this info is in the logs, but regular John Q User doesn't necessarily know how to look at them. The goal is to ultimately log play history and present it in the GUI for review later. 

Several applications for this come to mind: 

1) Simply review what you played
2) See if friends/family watched ahead in your favorite series!
3) Monitor children's viewing habits when parents aren't around
